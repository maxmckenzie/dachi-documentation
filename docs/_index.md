	<strong>Dachi</strong> is a powerful, fast and lightweight web framework, developed to be used by LemonDigits for rapid, well defined and consistant web development. Battle tested daily in production!
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
Dachi is very tightly based upon a MVC(+RH) development pattern using a combination of open-source projects to create a software framework that is designed to support the development of websites and applications. Dachi aims to alleviate overhead associated with the day to day struggles in web development, such as database access, view templating, session management and request routing. We promote heavy code reuse and librarification of code. Where possible we try to follow a pattern of 'generate before deployment' to add a massive speed boost to the basic tasks such as configuration, routing and module installation.
